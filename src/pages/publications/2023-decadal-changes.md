## Abstract

Our analysis of ocean color trends over the past two decades reveals fundamental shifts in marine ecosystem structure globally, with profound implications for ocean productivity and carbon cycling.

## Major Findings

- Systematic changes in phytoplankton community composition
- Expansion of oligotrophic gyres
- Shifts in seasonal cycles
- Impacts on marine food webs

## Global Implications

These changes have cascading effects throughout marine ecosystems, affecting fisheries, carbon sequestration, and climate regulation.
