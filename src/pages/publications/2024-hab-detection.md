## Abstract

We present an ensemble deep learning approach for real-time detection of harmful algal blooms (HABs) from multi-sensor satellite data, enabling rapid response to environmental threats.

## Approach

- Multi-sensor data fusion (MODIS, Sentinel-3, VIIRS)
- Ensemble of specialized CNN models
- Real-time processing pipeline
- Alert system integration

## Impact

Successfully deployed in operational monitoring systems, providing early warning for coastal communities and aquaculture operations.
