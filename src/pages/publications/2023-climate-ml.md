## Abstract

Using advanced machine learning techniques, we uncover complex relationships between climate drivers and coastal ecosystem responses across global scales, providing new insights into ecosystem vulnerability.

## Key Discoveries

- Non-linear responses to temperature changes
- Tipping points in ecosystem transitions
- Regional vulnerability hotspots
- Predictive models for ecosystem shifts

## Significance

This work provides a framework for predicting coastal ecosystem responses to future climate scenarios.
