## Abstract

We present a comprehensive global assessment of marine heatwave characteristics and trends using three decades of satellite sea surface temperature data, revealing accelerating frequency and intensity.

## Findings

- 50% increase in marine heatwave frequency since 1990s
- Hotspots identified in key ecosystem regions
- Strong correlation with ecosystem impacts
- Predictive indicators developed

## Data Products

All marine heatwave metrics are available through our open data portal for research and management applications.
