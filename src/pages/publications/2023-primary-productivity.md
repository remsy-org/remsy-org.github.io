## Abstract

We present a new algorithm for estimating primary productivity in optically complex coastal waters, addressing limitations of existing models in these challenging environments.

## Innovation

- Accounts for colored dissolved organic matter
- Incorporates seasonal variability
- Validated across diverse coastal systems
- 40% improvement in accuracy

## Applications

The algorithm has been adopted by several national monitoring programs for operational coastal ecosystem assessment.
