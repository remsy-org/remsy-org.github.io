## Abstract

Analysis of two decades of satellite ocean color data reveals significant shifts in marine ecosystem productivity patterns linked to climate change. Our comprehensive study integrates multiple satellite sensors to create a unified time series of ocean color trends from 2000 to 2024.

## Key Findings

- Significant warming-induced changes in phytoplankton communities
- Poleward migration of productivity zones
- Increased frequency of extreme ocean color anomalies
- Strong correlation with marine heatwave events

## Implications

This research provides critical insights into how marine ecosystems are responding to ongoing climate change, with important implications for fisheries management and marine conservation strategies.
