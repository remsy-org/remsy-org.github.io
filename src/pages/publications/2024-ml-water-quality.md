## Abstract

We present novel deep learning methods for accurate water quality parameter retrieval from satellite ocean color imagery in optically complex coastal waters. Our approach significantly improves upon traditional empirical algorithms.

## Methods

- Convolutional neural networks for spectral analysis
- Transfer learning from global to regional models
- Uncertainty quantification using ensemble methods
- Validation with in-situ measurements

## Results

Our method achieves 35% improvement in accuracy compared to standard algorithms for chlorophyll-a estimation in coastal waters.
