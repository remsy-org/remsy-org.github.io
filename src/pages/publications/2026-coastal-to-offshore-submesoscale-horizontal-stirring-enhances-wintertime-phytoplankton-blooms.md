abstract: "The large seasonal increases in marine photosynthetic organisms – i.e., phytoplankton blooms – are a ubiquitous oceanic phenomenon that contributes to the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and supports the growth of larger marine organisms. The underlying mechanisms controlling the intensity and timing of these blooms have been proposed to be dominated by vertical transport and mixing processes that are enhanced at fine-scale frontal and filamental circulations, commonly known as submesoscale currents. Here we show that the winter blooms characteristic of the ultra-oligotrophic waters of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, which manifest as a seasonal increase in satellite-derived levels of surface chlorophyll, are intensified by enhanced horizontal stirring induced by the submesoscale currents. Using ocean color remote sensing data and high-resolution numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the intensification of submesoscale currents in winter efficiently connect the coastal waters and the ultra-oligotrophic open-sea waters, thereby enriching the latter with chlorophyll-rich waters. A climatological chlorophyll time series comparison between two different regions equidistant to the Nile River Delta indicates that this submesoscale horizontal stirring mechanism accounts for the ∼ 24.8 % larger wintertime increase in surface chlorophyll observed downstream of the Nile Delta. These results shed new light on the processes governing phytoplankton bloom intensity and emphasize the important role of submesoscale horizontal stirring in modulating the marine ecosystem."
