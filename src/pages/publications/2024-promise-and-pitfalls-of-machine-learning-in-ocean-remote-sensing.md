abstract: "While a rich history of patchiness research has explored spatial structure in theocean, there is no consensus over the controls on biological patchiness andhow physical-ecological-biogeochemical processes and patchiness relate.The prevailing thought is that physics structures biology, but this has not beentested at basin scale with consistent in situ measurements. Here we use theslope of the relationship between variance vs spatial scale to quantify patchi-ness and ~650,000 nearly continuous (dx ~ 200 m) measurements - repre-senting the Atlantic, Pacific, and Southern Oceans - and find that patchiness ofbiological parameters and physical parameters are uncorrelated. We showvariance slope is an emergent property with unique patterns in biogeochem-ical properties distinct from physical tracers, yet correlated with other biolo-gical tracers. These results provide context for decades of observations withdifferent interpretations, suggest the use of spatial tests of biogeochemicalmodel parameterizations, and open the way for studies into processes reg-ulating the observed patterns."
