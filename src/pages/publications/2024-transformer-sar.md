## Abstract

We introduce a novel transformer-based architecture for automated detection and tracking of ocean eddies in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

## Methodology

- Vision transformer architecture adapted for SAR imagery
- Multi-scale feature extraction
- Temporal tracking using attention mechanisms
- Training on large-scale SAR dataset

## Performance

- 92% detection accuracy
- 15% reduction in false positives
- Real-time processing capability
