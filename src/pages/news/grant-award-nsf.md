# Lab Receives $1.2M NSF Grant for Marine Plastic Detection

The Marine Remote Sensing Laboratory has been awarded a prestigious $1.2 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to develop advanced artificial intelligence systems for detecting and tracking marine plastic pollution using satellite imagery.

## Project Overview

The three-year project, titled "AI-Enhanced Detection of Marine Plastic Pollution from Space," will be led by Dr. Sarah Mitchell, Lab Director and Professor of Marine Sciences. The interdisciplinary team includes researchers from computer science, oceanography, and environmental engineering.

### Key Objectives

1. **Algorithm Development**: Create deep learning models specifically designed for plastic detection in ocean imagery
2. **Validation Campaigns**: Conduct field studies to verify satellite observations
3. **Global Mapping**: Produce the first comprehensive global map of marine plastic distribution
4. **Open Source Tools**: Develop freely available software for the research community

## Research Innovation

"This grant allows us to push the boundaries of what's possible with satellite ocean monitoring," said Dr. Mitchell. "By combining cutting-edge AI with multi-spectral satellite data, we can detect plastic pollution at unprecedented scales and resolution."

### Technical Approach

The project will employ several innovative techniques:

- **Multi-sensor Fusion**: Combining data from NASA, ESA, and commercial satellites
- **Transfer Learning**: Adapting computer vision models to ocean applications
