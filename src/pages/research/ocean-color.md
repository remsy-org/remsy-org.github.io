# Ocean Color Remote Sensing Research

Ocean color remote sensing is a cornerstone of our research program, providing critical insights into marine ecosystem health, productivity, and response to environmental change. By analyzing the spectral properties of sunlight reflected from the ocean surface, we can quantify key biogeochemical parameters and track their variations across space and time.

## Overview

The color of the ocean provides a window into its biological and chemical composition. Phytoplankton, the microscopic plants that form the base of the marine food web, contain chlorophyll and other pigments that absorb and scatter light in characteristic ways. By measuring these optical signatures from space, we can map phytoplankton abundance, identify species composition, and assess water quality across vast ocean areas.

## Research Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Algorithm Development**: Create accurate retrieval algorithms for coastal and open ocean waters
2. **Validation**: Establish robust validation protocols using in-situ measurements
3. **Applications**: Apply ocean color data to address ecological and societal challenges
4. **Innovation**: Develop next-generation techniques using AI and machine learning

## Current Projects

### 1. Coastal Water Quality Monitoring

**Lead Researcher**: Dr. Maria Rodriguez  
**Funding**: EPA, $500K (2023-2025)

Developing specialized algorithms for optically complex coastal waters where traditional ocean color algorithms often fail. This project focuses on:
- Separating contributions from phytoplankton, sediments, and dissolved organic matter
- Accounting for atmospheric correction challenges in coastal zones
- Creating region-specific bio-optical models
- Real-time water quality assessment systems

### 2. Harmful Algal Bloom Detection

**Lead Researcher**: Dr. Sarah Mitchell  
**Funding**: NOAA, $750K (2022-2024)

Using multi-spectral and hyperspectral satellite data to detect and predict harmful algal blooms (HABs):
- Species-specific optical signatures
- Early warning systems for coastal communities
- Integration with oceanographic models
- Mobile app development for stakeholder alerts

### 3. Primary Productivity Estimation

**Lead Researcher**: Dr. Elena Petrov  
**Funding**: NASA, $450K (2023-2025)

Improving satellite-based estimates of ocean primary productivity:
- Photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) algorithms
- Phytoplankton physiological state indicators
- Carbon fixation rate models
- Climate change impact assessment

## Methodology

### Satellite Sensors

We utilize data from multiple ocean color sensors:

| Sensor | Platform | Spatial Resolution | Temporal Coverage | Key Applications |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
