# AI-Enhanced Detection of Marine Plastic Pollution

**Project Duration**: 2023-2026  
**Funding Agency**: National Science Foundation (NSF)  
**Award Amount**: $1.2 Million  
**Principal Investigator**: Dr. Sarah Mitchell  
**Co-Investigators**: Dr. James Chen, Dr. Maria Rodriguez

## Executive Summary

This NSF-funded project aims to revolutionize our ability to detect and monitor marine plastic pollution using artificial intelligence and satellite remote sensing. By developing cutting-edge deep learning algorithms specifically designed for ocean applications, we're creating tools that can identify plastic debris from space with unprecedented accuracy and scale.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Algorithm Development**
   - Design CNN architectures optimized for marine debris detection
   - Implement attention mechanisms for improved feature extraction
   - Develop multi-scale detection capabilities (1m to 100m+ patches)

2. **Validation Framework**
   - Conduct field campaigns for ground truth data collection
   - Establish validation protocols for satellite observations
   - Create benchmark datasets for algorithm testing

3. **Global Mapping**
   - Produce monthly global maps of plastic distribution
   - Identify accumulation zones and transport pathways
   - Track temporal changes in plastic pollution

4. **Tool Development**
   - Create open-source software packages
   - Develop web-based visualization platforms
   - Build API for real-time detection services

## Technical Approach

### Deep Learning Architecture

Our custom neural network architecture combines several innovative approaches:

```python
class MarineDebrisNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MarineDebrisNet, self).__init__()
        # Multi-scale feature extraction
        self.backbone = ResNet50(pretrained=True)
        
        # Attention mechanism for debris features
        self.attention = SelfAttention(channels=2048)
        
        # Spectral analysis branch
        self.spectral_branch = SpectralAnalyzer(bands=13)
        
        # Fusion and classification
        self.fusion = FeatureFusion()
        self.classifier = DebrisClassifier(num_classes=5)
```
